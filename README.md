# DeepCode Extension

Through the extension you can quickly start using DeepCode's code review and analysis within your development workflow. The extension will automatically alert you about critical vulnerabilities you need to solve in your code the moment when you hit _Save_ in your IDE. With DeepCode's superior code review you save time finding and fixing bugs before they go to production.

## DeepCode's AI Engine finds bugs

DeepCode uses symbolic AI to process hundreds of millions of commits in open source software projects and learns how to find serious coding issues. Because the platform determines the intent of the code — and not only the syntax mistakes — DeepCode identifies 10x more critical bugs and security vulnerabilities than other tools.

## Our AI provides explanation behind found bugs

In order to show the detailed explanation of a potential bug, we introduced a new AI technique called _Ontology_. With Ontology, we’ve integrated the capability to present logical argumentation used by the DeepCode engine. If you want to learn more about the technologies behind DeepCode, make sure to visit our website [DeepCode.AI](https://deepcode.ai) and the resources listed.

## Supported languages

JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, C/C++ (beta), C# (beta) and PHP (beta) are currently supported. We also provide specific coverage for VUE and REACT.

## Video on how to install and use the extension

- We've prepared a short video on how to install and use the extension. Head over to YouTube to quickly get the extension up and running:

  <a href="https://youtu.be/3J5cVuEJ8WE&utm_source=vscode-extension-readme" target="_blank">![](images/install-and-use-vs-code-extension.png)</a>

# Installation

You can find the DeepCode Extension in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. So, to install, you can either navigate to the [DeepCode Extension on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DeepCode.deepcode) and press _Install_ or use the build in mechanism in Visual Studio Code behind the _Extensions Icon_ ![Extensions Icon](images/extension_icon.png) in the sidebar.

## Tips on using the on-premise version

With the extension, you can scan code that is actually not stored in any repo yet. The extension bundles the code files and send them for analysis. You can define which backend infrastructure to use (provided by DeepCode or your own on premise installation).

By default the VS Code extension uses deepcode.ai. However you or your organisation is running DeepCode in combination with a self-managed BitBucket or Gitlab you can change the endpoint to your on-premise installation and upload the code to the on-premise version. You could do that by going to DeepCode's preferences and update the DeepCode's URL as shown in the video below:

# How to use it?

## PROTIP - DeepCode analysis on Save

- DeepCode's extension runs automatically when you opened a folder or project and hit _Save_ (or the keyboard shortcut).
- If you don't like to save while working we strongly recommend to [enable the AutoSave](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save).
- In the configuration of the extension, you can enable _Advanced Mode_ which enables you to manage the scanning process even better.

## Video on how to use the extension

- Here is a video on how to use the extension. In short - don't forget to save and you will be in good hands:

## DeepCode in action

Whenever DeepCode encounters an unseen project, you will be asked to provide consent for DeepCode to handle the code. Without the consent, DeepCode will not touch your code.

![DeepCode Consent](images/consent.png)

DeepCode will then bundle the files and run an analysis. From Extension Version 3.x on, you can find a DeepCode Icon in the sidebar ![DeepCode Sidebar Icon](images/DeepCode_extension_icon.png). It provides all the suggestions in a concise and clean view containing all information that is available on the online dashboard.

![deepcode problem](images/problem.png)

On the top left, you can see some statistics plus a list of files with the suggestions found for them. The icons here mean:
- ![Critical Icon](images/Critical_icon.png) Critical suggestion which should be addressed
- ![Warning Icon](images/Warning_icon.png) Warning suggestion which seems to be a coding error
- ![Information Icon](images/Information_icon.png) Information suggestion which points to style glitches or logical issues

Below, on the bottom left, you see a collection of helpful links about DeepCode.

In the middle, you can see the editor window showing the code that is inspected and below the _Problems_ window. These two provide syntax highlightning and context to the suggestion you are currently inspecting.

On the top right, you see the _DeepCode Suggestion_ window. It provides the argumentation of the DeepCode engine using for example variable names of your code and the line numbers in red. Also, here you can find links to external resources to explain the bug pattern in more detail (see the _More info_ link). Furthermore, you can see tags that were assigned by DeepCode such as _Security_ (this is an security issue), _Database_ (it is related to database interaction), or _In Test_ (it seems it is test code) to name a few. Moreover, you can see code from open source repositories that might be of help to see how others got rid of the issue at hand. Finally, you can insert the comments that command DeepCode to ignore this particular suggestion or all of these suggestions for the whole file by using the two buttons on the lower end of the window. You want to do this in the case that you know what you are doing or it is testing code that explicitly does something wrong.

We also want to mention that we included the feedback mechanism for possible false positive in the same way as you know it from the web based dashboard.

## How to ignore suggestions (text)

There are two key steps here:

   1. Ignore particular alert directly within its _DeepCode Suggestion_ window as mentioned above, the suggestions tooltip or 'bulb' menu:

   ![deepcode ignore menu](images/ignore_menu.png)

   1. Deepcode will create a code comment, that will inform our analysis engine to ignore it. Don't forget to specify a description why you think it needs to be ignored.

   ![deepcode ignore comment](images/ignore_comment.png)

## How to ignore suggestions (video)

- If the above information is not enough and want to see it in action, here is a video:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjDuDqUy7pw&utm_source=vscode-extension-readme" target="_blank">![](images/how-to-toggle-suggestions.png)</a>

## .dcignore file

- If you want to ignore certain files/folders (like *node_modules* for example), create a _.dcignore_ file. You can create it in any folder on any level starting from the directory where your project resides. The file syntax is identical to _.gitignore_:
